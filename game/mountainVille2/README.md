# World Run

**Team Members:** [William ngome, John ngome]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[example format: "It's like [Super Mario ] meets [Super Bingo] but with [different characters, different weapons, special powers, powerups and different locations in 2D]

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[The key aspect is to finish the game and gain coins before the time stops, It makes the player think fast not to waste his/her time before finishing, it's important because it makes the player think fast helping them in their day-to-day life, I will say it interacts with others well]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[the players are just to reach the finish line before the timer runs out while escaping enemies and collecting coins to upgrade characters and buy more characters, they'll aim is to get coins and powerups, they will have enemies with a new enemy in each level, they will get coins, gums, maybe characters]

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
[we will keep bringing new updates that will bring them, With the ability to play with friends online they will play and battle with them, We will put new game themes with the seasons ]
