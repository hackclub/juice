WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:01.066
Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:02.566 --> 00:03.466
I'm gonna just

00:03.466 --> 00:04.300
You're gonna stand?

00:04.300 --> 00:05.133
I'm just going to stand

00:05.200 --> 00:07.533
Alright, so I'm here with Paolo

00:08.433 --> 00:12.733
We are organizing the craziest thing that Hack Club has ever done

00:13.700 --> 00:14.800
It's called Juice

00:14.800 --> 00:16.666
It's the craziest thing that I've ever done too by the way

00:16.666 --> 00:17.633
It's called Juice

00:17.633 --> 00:23.200
So Juice is going to be a two month long game Jam where we are going to work together to make our own games

00:23.300 --> 00:25.133
I've never made an actual game before

00:25.133 --> 00:25.900
So

00:26.000 --> 00:26.800
Me neither

00:26.800 --> 00:27.166
Yeah

00:27.166 --> 00:30.466
We're going to figure it out together in the #juice channel

00:30.466 --> 00:32.900
We're going to have calls every week where we work together

00:32.900 --> 00:33.666
and make it happen

00:33.666 --> 00:36.933
So the first half of this is okay, we are going to work together for two months

00:37.000 --> 00:38.266
And make our own games

00:39.266 --> 00:42.066
The second half of this is where things get crazier

00:43.066 --> 00:48.266
The second half is we are going to be running an in-person popup cafe in Shanghai, China

00:48.266 --> 00:50.366
Where people are going to come in from the streets

00:50.366 --> 00:52.833
Come into the cafe and play our games

00:52.833 --> 00:55.566
Cool thing is our games are going to be totally languageless

00:55.900 --> 00:56.966
So what does that mean?

00:57.000 --> 01:02.766
That means that it is playable even you don't share the same language

01:02.766 --> 01:04.433
Yeah so no spoken words

01:04.433 --> 01:05.233
No written words

01:05.233 --> 01:05.666
No English

01:05.666 --> 01:06.766
No Mandarin, none of that

01:07.600 --> 01:10.000
We all just share a love of playing games

01:10.400 --> 01:11.366
I grew up playing games

01:11.366 --> 01:12.400
You grew up playing games

01:12.400 --> 01:13.666
Now we're going to make our own

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
And, yeah

01:13.800 --> 01:15.600
So let's make this happen together

01:19.400 --> 01:25.366
If you want to make this adventure happen everything you need to make it happen, all the tools you need are in your hands

01:25.366 --> 01:26.933
We have flight stipends available

01:26.993 --> 01:32.500
We have community of people making this happen together in the #juice channel

01:32.500 --> 01:35.766
and we also have me and Paolo

01:37.200 --> 01:40.666
I dropped everything in my life to come back to Hack Club to make this happen

01:40.666 --> 01:43.400
So if you want to make this happen let's make it happen together

01:43.400 --> 01:46.050
And I'll see you in the #juice channel

01:46.050 --> 01:47.999
Alright, adi√≥s!
