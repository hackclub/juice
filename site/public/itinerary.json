There's a bittersweet feeling to today's market run, knowing it's our second-to-last day at the cafe.\n\nThe vendors in this tech district seem different from those in Changning - perhaps more accustomed to catering to office workers rather than residents. We splurge a bit on premium fruits for special farewell menu items, wanting to make our final days at SparkLabs memorable for our visitors from the nearby tech companies."
