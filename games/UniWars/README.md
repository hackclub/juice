# Game Name

**Team Members:** Akhil Sharma (@ictinus0222)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Katana Zero meets Rockstar's Bully, but with Kanye West’s Graduation aesthetic—play as a student trying to survive the chaos of university life.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
It’s a mix of 2D action, exploration, and cutscenes, with a twist on the whole student life experience. You’ll juggle assignments, projects, and social drama while navigating campus life. The fun comes from figuring out how to balance everything while dealing with different challenges that pop up. Think ToDo lists, class presentations, and late-night study sessions and then using coffee as a battery—all with a touch of humor and chaos.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You’re a new student at uni, and it’s your job to navigate everything: from the classroom to the hostel, group projects, assignments, and the occasional “fight” for the last slice of pizza. Each day brings new tasks, social interactions, and obstacles. You'll move through levels, each representing a different part of uni life, with mini-challenges like avoiding getting caught sleeping in class or trying to finish a project while dealing with a distracted roommate.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The game will keep you hooked by throwing new challenges your way as you try to make it through your first year. As you progress, it gets harder—more assignments pile up, social drama increases, and you’ll need to be more strategic with your time. Every stage of the game will level up the chaos, and by the end, you’ll be trying to survive finals week or facing the ultimate uni showdown (maybe against your prof or the school rival).
