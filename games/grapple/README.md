# Grapple

**Team Members:** [Ron Dotan]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A platformer where you can't jump: your movement is controlled by a two buttons, your mouse, and the fundamental laws of physics.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You can't move. You can't jump. You move by shooting a cannon to launch yourself in the opposite direction and use a grappling hook to swing yourself to the end of the level, using momentum and the environment of the level to propel yourself to great heights (and greater speeds). The only goal is to complete the levels as fast as you can with the highest possible score.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The goal is to move from the start of the level (usually the right) to the end (left), where you are faced with various obstacles that you have to traverse. You grapple onto the walls to maintain momentum and swing around, and fire your cannon to accelerate, while using the cannonball to hit buttons and break destroyable obstacles. There are bonus objectives such as killing enemies or collecting coins that contribute to your score and a timer that records how fast you complete the level. The goal is to beat your best time and high score. At the end of a level you get a rank similar to Ultrakill depending on how well you did.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The scope is small, mainly just having a variety of unique levels that each present their own challenges. The way I will keep players engaged is by using simple but dynamic gameplay and an incentive to replay and speedrun. There should be at least twenty main levels, and maybe a few secret levels.

**Pretty much everything here is subject to change tho :/**
As Frank Sinatra once said, that's life.
