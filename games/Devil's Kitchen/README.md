In this game you and one of your friend go for a hike on a hill. You guys were chilling but suddenly your friend falls into a crack on that hill, that crack is very steep and is referred to as Devil's kitchen by the locals. It is said that once a person goes in there, they're gone forever. But you can't let your friend go this way so you decide to go into the Devil's Kitchen and  ̶s̶t̶e̶a̶l̶ ̶h̶i̶s̶ ̶f̶o̶o̶d̶, sorry I mean get your friend back :).
