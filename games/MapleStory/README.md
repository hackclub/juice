**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

Return to the classic Primitive Adventure Island, free from flashy pay-to-win elements, and rediscover the pure joy of gaming!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The core mechanism of this game is "Hard work pays off". We have designed a regular reward system. Players don't need to put in extra effort; they can receive rich rewards just by following the normal progress of the game. This mechanism not only encourages players to keep playing but also makes players feel that the game recognizes their efforts, thus increasing the fun and sense of accomplishment of the game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

The core gameplay of the game revolves around leveling up by defeating monsters and social interaction. Players will control cute paper character and embark on an adventure on the challenging Adventure Island. In this process, players need to constantly battle various monsters, gain experience points and items through battles, and improve their level and abilities. At the same time, the game emphasizes social elements. Players can communicate and cooperate with other players, complete tasks together, and share the joy of the game. In addition, the game is equipped with exquisite music to create an immersive gaming experience for players.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

To keep players engaged for 30 minutes, we have designed a mechanism where the game progress gradually accelerates. As the game progresses, the difficulty of the tasks and the rewards will gradually increase, keeping players fresh and challenging. However, we also make sure to avoid the game becoming completely automated and ensure that players need a certain level of participation. For example, in the process of leveling up by defeating monsters, players need to manually operate the character to attack and dodge, rather than letting the game do it automatically. In addition, we have also designed a rich reward feedback mechanism. When players complete tasks or achieve achievements, they can receive timely rewards and feedback, making them feel that their efforts have been rewarded and thus more willing to keep playing.
