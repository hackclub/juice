**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

You're Caine from John Wick but you got your eyes back.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

You need to observe without your environment without vision and move carefully dodging enemies.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

You're in a dark place. You send out sound pulses and based on their color and the way they reflect, you deduce what's in that direction.
Too many pulses can alert enemies.
You move to the next level when you find the exit.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

You move through progressively harder levels with more obstacles and enemies and mazes.
You can collect coins for a bonus.
