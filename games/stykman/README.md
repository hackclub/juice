**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Fireboy and Watergirl meets Undertale.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You have to move from room to room, collecting coins. Each room will start out with one coin, which you have to solve/ look for clues to find.
Eventually, people start appearing in the rooms. Harmless and largely irrelevant at first, but later on the coins will be with the people, and you have to either convice them to give it to you, or take it by force.
Its a unique mix of puzzle solving and morality-type RPG.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game starts out with the player dropping their wallet, losing all 15 of their valuable gold coins. A friend directs them to a building which has as many coins as they need, if they can find them.
**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will find each room/level both growing harder and introducing new mechanics. By the 4th room, you will have learned all puzzle mechanics, and will launch into harder, more challenging rooms. By the 7th room, the player meets another person, who they have to move out of the way to get the room's coin. This continues on, but it is clear that you can obtain coins from people in more ways than one.
