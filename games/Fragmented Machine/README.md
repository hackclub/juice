# Fragmented Machine

**Team Members:** @somebody else

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
it's like *Hollow Knight*, but way smaller, and themed around robots (in other words, it's a metroidvania).

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You have to start from having no movement controls or anything and basically fix yourself, and escape the lab you are trapped in. you will have a battery that each ability you equip will drain it a liitle, so you have to choose a build of certain abilities that suits how you play.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
you start with absolutely no abilities, not even being able to move, and you must collect pieces of other robots (and yourself) to reach new areas of the map and escape the lab.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
I'll keep players engaged by giving them a map to explore (and escape), with different and unique abilities to find.
