# Game Name

**Team Members:** Kai Pereira

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Shake it is a single player shop game where you get to own and run your own boba shop!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Shake it has an evolutionary mechanic to it, where you're upgrading your shop and feeling a sense of progression as you fulfill your customers orders and build your shop!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will start in a bare-bones shop with a bit of cash. Customers will enter your shop over time (relative to how big it is) and you or your employee will have to fulfill their boba or cafe order. They'll leave and you'll collect their check and clean up their dishes.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
I think what will keep people engaged is that they feel like they need to make progression on their shop so they can have more customers and a better/larger shop. I feel like a multiplayer mode could be REALLY cool and make people want to have competitive shops.
