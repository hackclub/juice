# Soul Loop

**Team Members:** 
Ryan George (@Vodrek77)

**Pitch**
Speedrun through a puzzle platformer where each attempt leads to spirits that can help you or haunt you.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The puzzle platformer section may/will be impossible to complete in a single run, for example, you may have to press a button 
to open a door, but upon leaving the button to go to the door, it closes. The player can restart a run at will, and each time, 
a copy of their past run (I'm thinking of copying inputs) will run alongside them, not being able to interact directly with them, 
but interacting with the level and physics around the player to help them (or hurt them) on their path to complete the level. 
Each of these "souls" may also have small, additional abilities to switch up gameplay and add optimizations for the speedrunning 
aspect of the game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will work to complete a level, using the loop mechanic and souls to do so. Upon the completion of a level, they'll also 
get their time shown, alongside a rating based on some pre-set values. The player *may* also be shown a leaderboard of times for 
the top runs. Alongside completing new levels and puzzles, the players will be encouraged through those aspects to try and get 
faster times through optimizations and changes to strategies which encourages exploration, imagination, and creates a gameplay loop 
for each individual level.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The original run will take some time in itself as each level does have a puzzle to figure out. After that, players are encouraged to 
replay and get better times with more game knowledge, experience, and ideas. The goal is that this gameplay loop will allow players to 
hunt for times as much or as little as they want. While I don't have the full scope figured out, I do intend to utilize a playtest 
sometime throughout the jam with 5-10 levels and 5-10 unique souls to allow people to give me feedback. With this feedback, I can 
continue to add levels, souls, and generally more content, as well as implementing improvements for any bugs or problems encountered 
during the tests.

*I do have some experience in Unity, though I'm sure the concept will be difficult to implement, but that's the fun of it! I mean, who 
doesn't like solving complex coding problems... I know I sure do :)*

*Also, a big thing for me is making sure movement feels satisfying, so that will also be fun to mess around with and learn how to 
implement.*
