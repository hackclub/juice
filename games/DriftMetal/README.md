**Team Members:** [Max H]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[A fishing metroidvania where you play as a scrapped robot who needs to buy limps to progress.]

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[The main mechanics would be fishing and exploration. I think what will make it fun is the feeling of progression, where as you fish, you can explore more, the more you explore the better the fish you will catch!]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Fish - buy limbs, batteries, fishing rods, and bait - explore - find new fishing locations (better fish) - fish some more!]

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
[I plan to susstain gameplay by having a progression system that the player can engage with. Part of this progression will be tied into exploration, so I also think the players curriosity will help hold engagment.]
