**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like **Vampire Survivors** meets **StarCraft's RTS Micromanagement**, with small, specialized squads raiding unstable and dangerous rifts with high-risk, high-reward mechanics.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Players control a small team of highly specialized mercenaries, each with distinct abilities and roles (e.g., tank, sniper, support). <!-- I will expand on the special types later, this is just the gist idea right now -->
This creates a blend of strategy and action as players position their units, time abilities, and prioritize threats during fast-paced, chaotic battles. <!-- think the special missions in the SCII campaign but a lot more chaotic/fast paced -->

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

1. **Contract Selection:** Players choose a mission offered by one of the mega-corporations, each with distinct objectives <!-- (e.g., harvesting resources, escorting mining drones, or eliminating elite enemies). -->
2. **Squad Deployment:** Select and equip your squad of 3-5 mercenaries, balancing roles like tanking, damage, and support, to maximize synergy for the mission.
3. **Rift Exploration:** Inside the rift, players navigate hostile environments while fighting waves of enemies. They collect rift resources scattered throughout the area, but enemies grow stronger and more numerous the longer they remain.
4. **Risk vs. Reward:** Players decide whether to retreat and safely extract their resources or press deeper for rarer materials and greater rewards.
5. **Extraction and Upgrades:** Successfully escape the rift to secure resources and use them for unit upgrades, base expansion, and unlocking advanced tech for future runs.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Each run lasts approximately 10-15 minutes <!-- this is what is planned, but the actual duration/scope per mission will likely change --> with varied enemy types <!-- think small+light+weak but faster vs. big+strong+tanky but slower enemies -->, and randomized rewards and upgrades ensuring <!-- (hopefully) --> no two sessions feel identical.

<!-- EDITOR NOTE: this will probably be a little much for 2 months, but I'll try to get the core mechanics and game loop done (e.g. mission selection, mercenary types & abilities, rewards, upgrades).
Scope is a little huge, but motivation just as much; plan to continue work after the event too -->
