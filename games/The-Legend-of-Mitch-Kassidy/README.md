# **How would you pitch your game in one line?**Â 
Tower Defense meets Vampire Survivors on a train that builds its own tracks across a post-apocalyptic open-world America.

# **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** 
- **Resources:** You're piloting a train that builds its own tracks. You need to get fuel to keep the engine running and materials to keep laying new tracks. 
	- You can get materials from the surrounding trees, rocks or debris and fuel from  
- **Enemies:** You kill the undead as well as knock-out/kill bandits that you come across. 
	- You sell the bodies of the undead to get money and you take the bodies of the bandits to claim dead-or-alive bounties.
	- Value earned from bounties decreases if the bandit is dead.
- **Collectibles:** Destroy buildings or structures that you come across to get the resources contained within them, as well as salvage defensive or offensive parts for your train. Sell these resources or use them to build new parts for your ever-expanding train.
- **Upgrades:** Buy trailers at strongholds across the country and furnish them with barricades or various types of turrets. Upgrade your engine to make it faster, or be able to lay stronger rails to access new locations.
- **Events:** These can be time-based or location-based. Night-times have a higher rate of undead and may even see other creatures or mini-bosses. Bosses may be located at certain places throughout the map, and bandit groups may be located at certain hotspots.

# **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** 
You drive a train across an open-world post-apocalyptic America, from the West Coast to the East Coast. Your train needs fuel to run and materials to lay tracks, which you either salvage from your surrounding or buy from strongholds across the country. You get money from selling bodies of the undead, claiming bounties for bandits or selling valuables obtained from scavenging.

Over time, you can buy trailers to store more items and assist you in protecting your train and scavenging. The end goal is to reach the East Coast.

# **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** 
The player traverses across different locations and environments. The player can't beeline to the end since the difficulty increases the closer you get to the East Coast, rather than time, and some regions are blocked due to their unique terrain for which you'll have to build upgrades. Overall, this has the potential to be a very engaging game with multiple mechanics that the player has to take care of, making it a mix between fast-paced and strategic gameplay.
