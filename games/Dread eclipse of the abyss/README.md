to hollow knight.     

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic of game is a character who is lost in dark world, you having little visibility through your lamp, have to fight with
unexpected stuff and enemy, with unique stories unfolding through out the way. and have to light up the whole map as you reach the end.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
a platformer game with lot of levels and visual storytelling throught the game with it's own ambience. player have to progress through level 
by fighting the enemy and various objects with some puzzles! the player light up whole map at end side of level to progress to another level. 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
long map with lot of fighting and storytelling in such way to keep player engaged without taking too much of time! with additional puzzles, it 
will be more hard and long puzzles will keep player engaged with keeping in mind to make it smooth and easy.
