**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like a pixel art version of no man's sky with dungeon crawler features.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The ability to explore different planets that each have a different environment, entities and resources. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Progress through planets by obtaining the best materials and avoiding alien enemies. Depart the planet by repairing a rocket launcher pad that can send you further every time. As they progress there are different planets the can choose to land on depending on what planet or ore the chose to use for their launch pad.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Each planet will have diverse entities and biomes to explore. Players will aim to get to the last planet (for their chosen route). They could then turn back and aim for the planets they missed giving them the other endings.
