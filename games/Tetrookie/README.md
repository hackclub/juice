#  Tetrookie (Tetris but Cookie Clicker)

**Team Members:** Myself (Afonso Beato)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[example format: It's like Tetris meets Cookie Clicker. Basically, it's tetris with an item shop. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Tetris is already fun, so why not add the extra fun and weirdness of Cookie Clicker. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You play tetris. You're not allowed to die. If you die, you lose.
You get powerups. You can use those powerups to make your experience better.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will be engaged due to the sudden garbage. There would be like a garbage limit (garbage equals finished lines) and when you fill it, you have to lock in and clean it all up! Garbage could be burnt using money that you get from finishing lines (gas costs are high, so we need to make people pay.)
