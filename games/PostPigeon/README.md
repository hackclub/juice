# Post Pigeon

**Team Members:** Dakota R.

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like planet of luna meets turnip boy commits tax evasion, but with the movement feeling like flappybird.
Your a carrier pigeon who delivers messages, Having to solve puzzles to reach your destination.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Flight feels like flappy bird with button mashing required to go up, combined with the ability to poop on passerby's beneath. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player needs to deliver a letter to someone, and encounters puzzles and roadblocks along the way. Some puzzles require helping other people, others require combat. Once they complete the delivery, they are paid in bread crumbs, that can be used to buy hats or upgrade flight

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Each Delivery will introduce new challenges, from birdkour (bird parkour) to puzzles. Lore Quirky humor will also be used to keep players engaged.
