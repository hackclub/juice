How would you pitch your game in one line?
you're a robot that hates its job and wants to speak to its boss... in the top floor of a giant unfriendly facility

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
your little robot dude needs to make friends in order to traverse the dangerous maze-like giant warehouse of doom, and since they all have different jobs, they'd make great help in your escape

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
essentially, its a metroidvania with some funky platforming moves, climbing around different areas, meeting friends, fighting bosses, and breaking and entering in to more areas

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
besides the (hopefully) smooth movement, players are gonna want to find out what this whole place's deal is, like a silent mystery you yourself have to put together; that and its fun watching your robot guy learn new tricks
