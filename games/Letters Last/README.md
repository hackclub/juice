# Letters Last

**Team Members:** Tanmay Raj Krishna

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Deliver letters as a pigeon with world-building like that of A Short Hike.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Interacting with different people in the world and doing their quests.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You play as a pigeon who delivers letters. You can't fly continuously as energy depletes so you do quests to get some food to regain energy.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The game will have a story with every letter delivery. And then the quests that they'll do in between. These will be enough for more than 30 minutes of gameplay.
