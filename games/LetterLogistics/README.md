**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a game like the landfall Archives postnord simulator but more focused on sorting and becoming the main postal service. 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The building mechanics, and upgrading things.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will have to make, remake, and upgrade a postage sorting factory to sort different types of mail to be sent out. The amout of mail coming in increases over time. For every peice of mail sorted they get a small amount of money to keep growing the factory. The money is shown as coin stacks so there is no text the builing system just uses icons.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player starts in a small building with little space to sort things, they will have to make a belt system to sort the incoming mail, to make money. After they make euogh money they can upgerade there factory. Each factory will have more space than the last, but they will also have more types and larger amounts of mail to sort. the game ends when you get to te last factory and can sort all of the mail without a problem.
