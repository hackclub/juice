**How would you pitch your game in one line?** 

It's like Rain World meets Psyconauts, but with 3D procedural animation of large creatures you need to run from in a 1st person POV

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** 

It'll be a parkour game where your goal is to run. Think something similar to Karlson where the movement is really satisfying to play with.

I also want to do some mind-fuckery in this game - haven't planned too much of that yet though. I want Omori Whitespace vibes for this part.

Finally, I think a mechanic where you also lose strength if you use certain powers would be cool. Your blood is your weapon??

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** 

You run from giant centipeds and other creatures, on a map that's very much half void! Collect shards of memory throughout the game, and gain more power + ways to fight back. (I guess it becomes more of a FPS game?)

This will probably be like Celeste where there are multiple chapters and eventually you beat the game.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** 

run.
