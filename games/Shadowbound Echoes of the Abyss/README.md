Shadowbound: Echoes of the Abyss

"It's like Hollow Knight meets Portal but with a time-warping shadow clone mechanic that challenges your strategy and reflexes."  

The game revolves around a "shadow echo" mechanic. Players can create a shadow clone of their past actions, which moves and interacts with the environment as they did before. This allows players to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, and traverse obstacles by strategizing the timing and placement of their shadows. The mechanic is fun because it blends puzzle-solving, combat, and platforming into a single dynamic system, rewarding creativity and skillful execution.  

- Players explore a mysterious, interconnected world filled with ancient ruins and dangerous creatures.  
- They uncover secrets, defeat enemies, and solve puzzles by using their shadow clone to trigger switches, distract foes, or assist in platforming sections.  
- Players collect "Abyssal Shards" to upgrade their abilities and unlock new traversal mechanics like double jumps, wall runs, or time-slowing powers.  
- Challenges include managing resources (like energy for shadow clones), navigating tricky environments, and learning enemy attack patterns.  
- Rewards include new abilities, hidden lore, and visual upgrades to their shadow abilities.  

- Introduce new mechanics progressively, starting with simple shadow interactions and scaling up to complex multi-clone puzzles and boss fights.  
- Create varied biomes with distinct aesthetics and challenges (e.g., lava caverns, icy peaks, and crumbling temples).  
- Include a strong sense of progression with meaningful upgrades, intriguing mysteries, and optional challenges for completionists.  
- Use a compelling mix of combat, puzzles, and exploration to keep gameplay fresh.  

The scope will focus on a tightly designed 3-5 hour experience, with polished mechanics, a rich world, and a strong gameplay loop, allowing for potential future expansions.
