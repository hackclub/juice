# Twilight Rift

**Team Members:** Henry @HenryNerd)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Its in the same style as stardew valley but it's a 2d shooter in a maze.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Each time a level is started the maze is generated diffrently. This makes it fun because there is no memory of the layout so everyone is one the same skill level. Also players will race to get the fastest time to complete all the objectives and make it to the center of the maze.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
Player spawns in to maze then get a list of objectives. Then has to navigate the maze well facing badies and completing objectives. Then they have to make thier way to the center of the maze. They are also timed on how long it takes them to do it.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Because there is varability with the map being diffrent every time and you have the option of scores being on a public leaderboard.
