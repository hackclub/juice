### **How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like Stardew Valley meets an industrial farm (Chef RPG for farming), where managing livestock, crops, and automated production chains turns a small homestead into a thriving agricultural empire.

### **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The key mechanic of **Farmworks** is balancing traditional farming with automated efficiency. Players will raise animals, grow crops, and set up production lines to refine raw goods into valuable products. The farm evolves from a humble plot into a well-oiled agribusiness through strategic management and optimization.

As players advance, they can:

- Raise chickens, cows, and other livestock while automating feeding, milking, and egg collection.
- Grow crops and develop processing facilities to create high-quality products like cheese, bread, and canned goods.
- Expand operations with advanced tech like irrigation systems, automated feeders, and greenhouses.
- Manage supply chains, fulfill orders, and build relationships with nearby towns and businesses.
- Research upgrades to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and optimize production cycles.

Balancing hands-on farming with automation and trade will keep gameplay engaging and rewarding.

### **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players begin with a small farm, manually feeding animals and tending crops. As they earn money, they unlock tools and automation, allowing them to process goods faster and expand their business. Managing time and resources efficiently is key—players must decide when to automate, expand, or invest in better technology.

- **Farming & Production:** Plant, harvest, and process crops while raising animals for milk, eggs, and meat.
- **Automation & Optimization:** Upgrade equipment, automate repetitive tasks, and streamline supply chains.
- **Trading & Expansion:** Sell goods, complete contracts, and reinvest profits to build a self-sustaining farm.
- **Exploration & Upgrades:** Discover new technology, improve efficiency, and unlock specialized production chains.

The challenge comes from optimizing the balance between manual work, automation, and resource management while keeping the farm running smoothly.

### **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**

Players will be drawn in by the satisfying progression of turning a small farm into a large-scale operation. The constant cycle of expanding, refining, and optimizing ensures there's always something to work toward. Engaging elements include:

- The joy of setting up and fine-tuning production lines.
- Completing orders and seeing the farm evolve into an efficient system.
- Unlocking new technologies, crops, and machinery to expand production.
- Managing relationships with towns and traders to build a reputation and gain better deals.
- Experimenting with different farm layouts and automation strategies for the best results.

Every decision, from what crops to plant to how to streamline production, keeps players engaged and invested in their farm’s growth.
