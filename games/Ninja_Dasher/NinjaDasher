# Game Name: NinjaDasher

**Team Members:** [Anvay Ajmera]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Temple Run meets Super Mario Bros but with a simple 2D layout, and an Avatar: The Last Airbender twist!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game will focus on 2D character movement and jumping, where they can pass platformer levels and defeat monsters at the end. Timing and precision will be key to beating this game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will have a Ninja as a character, and they will have to beat levels by making it to the finish line door, where they can enter more levels. Eventually, there will be a boss fight at the end.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The levels will be hard enough to make the player spend 5-10 minutes beating. With 5 levels and a boss fight, the came will last at least 30 minutes. The scope is focused on creating polished, handcrafted levels with engaging combat and simple platform game mechanics.
