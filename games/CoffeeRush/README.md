**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like the Papa's (something)eria To Go! games combined with a bit more restaurant management as opposed to just making the food/drinks

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player must complete minigames involving timing events and puzzles while working the coffee-making equipment. They must also keep a clear head while doing this to manage multiple customers at a time.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
- Walk from table to table, taking orders
- Walk back to the coffee station with the order tickets
  > Each station (bean grinder, coffee machine etc) will have it's own challenge you need to complete to work the machine
  > This could include a quicktime event or a puzzle you need to solve
- With the finished drinks, go table to table delivering the drinks
- You are rated by the customers on how well you did. The higher you rating, the more new customers will come and the more money you will make
- At the end of each day, use money you earned to upgrade your restaurant

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
The game will follow a day system. As more days progress, the game will get harder (more customers arriving to manage), but you will also unlock new ingredients, the ability to hire staff etc
