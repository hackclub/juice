**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like ***Monkey Mart*** meets ***Gimkit Apocalypse***, where you manage a business (not really but you get the idea), battle monsters, and upgrade your heroes and resources."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Players manage a dungeon, assigning workers to generate resources while sending heroes to battle enemies. The game has idle mechanics, so progress continues even when you're not playing. Players use loot to upgrade both the dungeon and heroes.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Explore the World: Move around a 2D map, uncovering new areas and discovering resources.
Recruit Workers: Buy and assign different workers (like heroes or units) to automate tasks such as gathering resources or defending your area.
Fight Enemies: Battle increasingly difficult enemies that appear as you progress, using your workers to help you fight.
Upgrade and Expand: Use collected resources to upgrade your workers, unlock new abilities, and improve your worldâ€™s defenses.
Progress and Scale: As enemies get stronger, continuously expand and optimize your team to survive and progress further.


**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Incremental upgrades and rewards.
Active and idle progression balance.
Short-term goals like defeating enemies and collecting items.
Simple, automated combat with satisfying feedback.
Enemies get harder as you go on.
