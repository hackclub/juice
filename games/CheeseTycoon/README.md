**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Bitlife meets Cookie Clicker but with taxes and rent being actual factors, and to meet those requirements, you gotta sell some cheese.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
This is a "regular" tycoon based game where the player must sell lots and lots of cheese to make a nice living for themselves and maybe even start a family. You are able to get more money, find love, and have children. However, this is also a "delay the inevitable" type of game, where the player must have rent, pay off debts, and keep their family alive, lest the player gets arrested.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The game starts as a regular clicker game, where there are 3 steps. Collect and bottle milk, make it into cheese, and sell it to the masses, to earn a nice profit. Eventually,  you'll hire employees to do the clicking for you, like most clicker games. Then, later it will evolve into a life simulation game where you can't just sit back and relax. Many random events will occur, like finding a partner, weather disasters, workers strikes, prices tanking, rent payments and taxes, etc. If you can't keep up with the speed, you can die, get arrested, etc, and your game will end.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Clicker games all meet the same fate of just sitting there, accumulating resources, not doing anything. This is the type of game that punishes the player for not paying  attention. The player is on their toes at all times and must be to get the different endings, like ending up alone, or living a happy life, or getting arrested for tax evasion.
