**Team Members:** Jesus

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
"It's like *Temple Run* meets *Mirror's Edge* but with *time-bending shadow clones*."

## **What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
- **Shadow Cloning:** Players can rewind time to create "shadow clones" of themselves that repeat their past movements. These clones can interact with objects or activate switches to help solve puzzles, clear obstacles, or defend against enemies.  
- **Momentum-based Parkour:** Players can perform smooth parkour moves like wall-running, vaulting, and sliding to traverse an ever-changing environment.  
- **Dynamic Environments:** Obstacles, platforms, and enemies constantly change and react to the player's actions, keeping players on their toes.

## **How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
1. **Run and Explore:** Players sprint through levels filled with obstacles, enemies, and environmental puzzles.  
2. **Use Shadow Clones:** At key moments, players can rewind time and leave behind a clone to assist in solving puzzles or covering two objectives at once (e.g., one clone flips a lever while the player escapes).  
3. **Collect and Upgrade:** Players collect "Time Orbs" scattered throughout the levels to upgrade abilities like longer shadow durations or faster rewind cooldowns.  
4. **Face Challenges:** Environments become progressively harder, with collapsing platforms, enemies that target clones, and time-based puzzles requiring quick thinking.  
5. **Win the Level:** Players reach the end goal by unlocking a portal while overcoming challenges and achieving bonus objectives like collecting all orbs or finishing within a time limit.

## **How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**  
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Levels start easy but become more complex as new mechanics are introduced, such as timed shadow interactions, clone-based puzzles, and enemy encounters.  
- **Scoring System:** Players are scored on speed, orbs collected, and clone efficiency. This motivates replayability and mastery.  
- **Time Trials:** After completing a level, players can race against their best shadow run to beat their own time.  
- **Unlockable Abilities:** Players can unlock new parkour moves, longer shadow durations, or even deploy multiple shadows for complex puzzles.  
- **Endless Mode:** A procedurally generated mode where the goal is to survive as long as possible.
