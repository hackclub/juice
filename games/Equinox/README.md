# Equinox

**Team Members:** Sophia Evans

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
As the last sapling of the Equinox Tree, you must restore balance to the world by journeying through the fractured seasons and rekindling their harmony.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The game will have immersive environments and aesthetics. Players will experience inspiring, dynamic worlds representing Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter, each with unique visuals and soundscapes. 
Music and sound are core to the gameplay. Players use melodies to solve puzzles, interact with the environment, and gradually heal the broken seasonal landscapes.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Equinox will be a story game. The player will move through 4 different main quests for each season, with side quests along the way until they restore the Equinox Tree.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
With changing scenary, story, and enviornment, I hope to keep the player engaged with them motivated to reach the end of the story.
