**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
In this action/puzzle game, you're tasked with fighting your way through ancient civilizations and completing their time travel machines--hopefully, you'll eventually find your way home.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
There are many time-based mechanics: varied art and enemy types across differing times and places, unique puzzles centered around time travel, and combat or movement enhancing items found along the way (relating to time).

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players will guide the character through civilizations filled with different enemies, blazing new paths and collecting items off a (visual) checklist as they go. Once they reach the end of the path, they'll use their wits and items they've collected to complete a time machine and move on to the next area. After they leave an area, they'll have items to use in future ones (ideas include a dash, time slower-downer, and undo button).

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will be mainly engaged by fighting various types of enemies and avoiding traps along the way. They also might have to ponder over a puzzle or go retrieve a key component to a time machine every once in a while.
