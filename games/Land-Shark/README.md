# Game Name

**Team Members:** [Sarah Ngai]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[Visual and story style of Mouthwashing and gameplay of Spiritfarer, but...as a land shark!]

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Game mechanics are secondary to the stories. However, the game will include puzzles, mazes, and mini quests.]

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Players have no obvious goal, but are encouraged to interact with the various creatures of the deep and above land. Players will learn their stories and utilize that knowledge to help solve the problems of another!]

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
[Land Shark! will engage its players over a 30 minute period by interweaving the different narratives of the different creatures to increase the overall stakes.]
