**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** 
Players take on the role of a street food vendor where satisfying cooking mechanics meet intense time and resource management challenges.
The goal is simple yet compelling: cook, serve, and manage your business to support your family and thrive.

**How does the game actually play?(Core Game Loop)** 
players step into the challenging world of a street food vendor.
Every day, players must carefully purchase supplies to prepare and sell delicious street food to customers,
all while making enough profit to support their family and plan for the future.
The stakes are high—players must balance three critical goals:
Making a Daily Profit: Sell food to customers efficiently, attract more buyers, and adapt to changing supply costs and customer demands.
Feeding the Family: Allocate earnings to ensure the family is well-fed and healthy. Neglecting this responsibility could lead to dire consequences.
Saving for Tomorrow: Manage resources wisely to ensure enough money is available to buy supplies for the next day.
If the player went broke or family died out of hunger. Then he loses the game. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? what ‘s the general scope of your game(will change as you go)?** 
In the game, players take on the role of a street food vendor working hard to make a daily profit while balancing the responsibility of feeding their family.
Each day presents unique challenges, such as fluctuating supply costs, unexpected family expenses, and increasing financial pressures.
To survive, players must strategize to grow their profits and adapt to the evolving demands of their circumstances.

The game is structured into levels, with each level introducing new street food items to sell.
allowing them to attract more customers and earn higher profits. However, higher levels also come with increased competition.
