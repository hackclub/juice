# Echo Veil

**Team Members:** En Qiao & Terry Mao

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
It's like *Undertale* and *Hollow Knight*, but with rhythm-based echo-location in a shadow world.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
The environment starts shrouded in darkness, and sound waves reveal obstacles, enemies, and safe zones for a brief moment. So it's an echo based visibility system. Obstacles respond to the beat of the music, creating a fast-paced, immersive experience that challenges both rhythm and reflexes. Players can also emit their own smaller echoes to illuminate their surroundings.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
Players navigate a level, avoiding dangers while searching for the exit. Music drives the gameplay, with beats and melodies triggering waves that light up the world and create hazards. Players must dodge hazards such as beams, shockwaves, and projectile bursts by staying on beat and predicting patterns based on sound. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
Levels grow more challenging as players advance, with faster beats, complex obstacle patterns, and reduced reaction times. We will have multiple levels for 30 minutes of playtime.
