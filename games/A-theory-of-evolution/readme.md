How would you pitch your game in one line? Our game is like Spore, but with modes of transport and you can only get to new achievements if you excel at your current level, a simple but unique twist.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? For every mode of transport, you have to be the best at it to be able to move onto a new means of transport.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) Players start with a basic mode of transport and progress to more advanced modes by excelling at their current method. The ultimate goal is to achieve the highest level of transport.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game? The game features significant changes between each level of transport, starting with more challenging levels and progressing to easier ones, reflecting human adaptation. This keeps players engaged by presenting new challenges and rewards.

Remember: Focus on gameplay mechanics and player experience. Save the details about story, art style, sound design, UI flowcharts, marketing plans, or achievements for later.
