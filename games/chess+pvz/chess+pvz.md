# Chess Vs Zombies

**Team Members:** Laney

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a two person game, with one person playing as the chess pieces and the other person playing as the zombies.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
[Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]
You need to strategize on how to defat all the zombies. It's especially fun since it is meant to be played with a friend, either online or right next to you.
Chess pieces have cool downs per move so its a nerf of them (and since there is no other color to make a move)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
Players match up against each other and the zombies side places zombies trying to kill the chess's king. and the chess side has to survive for 5 minutes or so.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
[Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]
Offering unlockable content like new zombies, and unlockingabilities for the chess pieces (random drop from killing a zombie?)
