# Catfish Chronicles: A Cozy 2.5D Fishing Adventure

**Team Members:** Eduard G. (funtime.foxy on dc and on slack)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like Animal Crossing meets a cozy fishing adventure, driven by a quirky rent-collection backstory."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Engaging fishing mini-games, a relaxing progression system with home upgrades, and a languageless quest system that sparks creativity and exploration. The rent-driven urgency adds a light challenge and narrative hook.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
After waking up to a rent notice, players fish through small mini-games, selling or eating their catch for coins and power-ups, complete quests for rewards, and use earnings to pay rent, upgrade their home, or unlock new areas.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will enjoy completing fishing challenges, upgrading their cozy home, and exploring the day-night cycle for rare fish and dynamic quests, all while managing their rent payments and unlocking more content.
