**Team Members:** Abigail Loken, Damien Jennings, Carol Hercules, Diego Sanchez-Rivera

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Celeste meets Doodle Hop but you have to worry about your colors

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The main mechanic is that the player changes through colors and can only jump on the same color as themselves. In the beginning of the level they can set what colors they will change throughout the level. The player will also be able to decide the time interval they are each color.  
Example: In the beginning of the level the player could choose to be orange for 30 seconds, followed by being purple for a minute, then finally choose to be green for 90 seconds. The player is allowed to preview the level before choosing colors. Time for color could be in ticks (30 second intervals). Players will only be allowed to choose a color for a max for 3 ticks (so no spamming of a singular color). The player will be going up and each level will increase in difficulty.


**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The player will be trying to solve and complete each level. They will face the challenge of the different puzzles of the different levels.  The player will feel rewarded by solving each level. While also feeling rewarded by advancing upwards.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The player will stage engaged by becoming more challenged with the increase of difficulty within each level. The game will start with a tutorial level where the player will be encouraged to fail. With the encouragement the player will learn the mechanics of the game.
