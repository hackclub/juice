**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's a 2d story-based adventure game that uses unique control perspectives to tell a narrative.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The biggest unique mechanic is how the control scheme shifts based on different interactions the player is doing. Sometimes, you'll be looking through the perspective of someone on the outside but still controlling youself, and sometimes you'll be looking through your own perspective but only able to control things around you.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Most of the gameplay will involve adventuring through different mystical scenery that represents different parts of the main character's life, interacting with various creatures or people along the way, solving small puzzles to unlock different areas and at certain moments using unqiue battling mechanisms where the player isn't fully in control to fight off evils that try to attack the player.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Sustaining gameplay will be tricky, seeing as it's a story-based game, but we think there'll be unqiue enough control schemes that it will kind of take a moment to get used to, and force the player to slow down a bit and really appreciate every part of the game.
