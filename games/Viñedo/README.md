**Team Members:** Victorio

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Fast paced turn-based combat rouge-like.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Crafting a build of consumables, characters and modifiers that can beat all the 6 waves and try new/other builds.
The game doesn't need to (and preferably won't) have a fight theme, "attacks" don't need to be attacking anything, could be gaining points or anything. I still need to think about that.
The main idea is to mix team/deck building and randomness from Balatro with turn-based "combat" like in persona or other RPGs.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Every game starts with new and different consumables, characters and modifiers [elements] that can be bought in a shop at the end of each round.
Each round has a set amount of turns, if the players doesn't beat the wave in that amount of turns, they lose.
Each character has a turn and can  "attack", "defend" or use a consumable. Modifiers are passive elements that affect the run [for example, "give +1 turn"]. Each element is sellable and you can only have a limited amount of.
The objective is to beat 6 "waves".
