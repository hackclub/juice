# Mare Luminis

**Team Members:** Micah Edwards

**How would you pitch your game in one line?** Dredge meets Under The Waves, mixed with Harry Potter Gringotts curse-breaker mechanics, but more focused on puzzles that involve bioluminescent light.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** You must attempt to solve the many puzzles that involve searching for subtle clues in the environment. In addition, using sound, players can uncover more mysterios clues and treasure. No two runs are the same, as the puzzle locations are ever-changing.

As the player, you play an integral part in preserving the ecosystem, by leaving as little impact as possible on the environment. But at the same time, you are trying to retrieve and clean up the fragments of darkness left at the bottom of the sea (that is what the puzzles are for!)

Every round, you slowly uncover clues as to what happened in the first place. By learning from the mistakes of others, you will learn how to successfully remove the darkness without being corrupted by it.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** Players explore the ruins and wrecks, in order to gather clues to solve the puzzles, in turn to break the curses and save the ocean. They operate a submarine equipeed with needed gear for most tasks, although upgrades may be needed for some puzzles.. There are many small puzzles to solve also. These involve things from rotating mirrors, to bouncing sound waves, to spinning runes!

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** There will easily be more than 30 minutes of content. the initial phase of the game introduces players to the exploration of the bioluminescent zone, discovery of the darkness, and breaking of 1 or two curses.

The scope will expand from initially appearing to be simply an ocean exploration game with a few fun twists, to becoming much more advanced, involving mind-bending puzzles and storylines. This game will definitely share similarities with Dredge, as it will also have the horror elements to it!

There are three types of puzzles: Bioluminescent, Acoustic, and Flux. Bioluminescent could range from rotating mirrors to bounce light, or matching different colors to each other. Acoustic would involve either selecting sound frequencies to create a melody, to reflecting the sound waves. Finally, Flux puzzles involve everything else, which would be the more physical-based puzzles. This would be stuff like rotating orbs, cubes, combination locks, and stuff like that!

At first you start at your base station, which is situated at the brink of an immense chasm. Then, as the game progresses, you begin to explore further and further down it, solving clues on the way down to the bottom, where you would find the final boos level. I am not entirely sure what would be here, probably involving reflecting sound and light at the boss, without being damaged.
