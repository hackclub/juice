### Game Name: Shadow Chase

**Team Members:** Vincent Nderitu, Simon Ng'ang'a

**Pitch:** It’s like *Hide and Seek* meets *Pac-Man* but with a twist: you’re a shadow trying to escape light sources while collecting glowing orbs.

**Key Mechanics:**
- Control a shadow that moves through a maze.
- Avoid light sources that shrink your shadow—if fully exposed, you lose.
- Collect glowing orbs to grow your shadow and gain abilities (e.g., temporary invisibility or speed boosts).

**Core Game Loop:**
- Navigate the maze, avoid light sources, and collect orbs.
- As you progress, the maze gets harder (more lights, faster enemies).
- The goal is to survive as long as possible and collect all orbs to win.

**Engagement:**
- Increasing difficulty levels and power-ups keep players engaged for 30+ minutes.
- The scope is small: one maze with multiple levels and simple mechanics.
