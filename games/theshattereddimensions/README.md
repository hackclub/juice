- **Dynamic Dungeons:** Procedurally generated dungeons with puzzles, traps, and mobs make each run unique and challenging.
- **Elemental Combat and Survival:** Each dimension introduces themed hazards (e.g., drowning in Water, burning in Fire) and mobs that require adapting strategies to survive.
- **Shard Collecting:** Finding shards in dungeons is essential to progress, unlocking the ultimate Life Dimension.
