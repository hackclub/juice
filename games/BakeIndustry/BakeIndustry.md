**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

In this game your goal is to make the most french food possible (croissants, baguettes, ...) and flood the market with them to assure french supremacy in the food industry. It's a mix of Mindustry and some other factory games.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Factory planning & optimization! You can spend countless hour making sure everything is running at 100% efficiency. There will also be some sort of tech tree to keep improving your factory!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players start with a limited supply of basic material like flour, water and basic equipment and then use them to create & sell some food to get more money and unlock new recipes and equipment. There will be contracts wich will help you unlock new ressources, better contracts for flour or water or even a new market (new continents) to sell your food???)

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Your goal is to make more and more food! I've already experienced some factory games (the best one in my opinion) and they can keep you entertained by always providing you new things to do and new way to be more productive !
