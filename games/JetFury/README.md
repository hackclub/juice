**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
[Jet Fury is a fast action game where you fly a jet, dodge enemy razers, and shoot back. Collect power-ups to get stronger. Can you survive and beat your high score?]

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanic is flying a plane, shooting razers at enemy planes, and dodging the razers they shoot at you. Power-ups help you by giving you more shields or allowing you to shoot more razers. If you get hit four times, you lose the game! Itâ€™s fun because you need to be quick, dodge carefully, and use power-ups to stay alive and defeat enemies.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. You control a plane flying in the sky and shoot razers at enemy planes.
2. The enemy planes shoot razers at you, and you must dodge them to avoid taking damage.
3. Power-ups appear during the game, giving you extra shields (more health) or allowing you to shoot more razers at once.
4. If you get hit by enemy razers four times, you lose the game.
5. The game saves your highest score so you can try to beat it each time you play.
6. The game has cool sound effects, explosions, and camera shakes to make it exciting!

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
