# Floppy Fray

**Team Members:** Bartosz, Arnav, Hubert

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Combine Human Fall Flat's platformer, logical elements with Drunken Wrestlers 2's combat. Make it crazy.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You are floppy/drunken - it's the fun part. Try to fight with movement controls, annihilate your opponent or cooperate through platformer stages. Everything is harder cause of how you move.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players can either go into battles with each other, must score as much points as possible for hitting opponents knocking him out reward is... milk!. They can also go through platformer stages together, or fight against each other during them, in this scenario they should either both or one of them go to the end of level - the milk store.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players can choose either battle mode or platformer mode, giving them flexibility and change of game loop if needed. For the first case scenario, they shall fight against each other, use their envoriement to their advantage. Punching your enemy, kicing them, dodging. Typical round should take 5-10 minutes, but can be more. Power ups can show up after some time, some modifications like heavy hits can be chosen too. There is also a platformer mode - where players can either race or cooperate with each other and try to beat levels by mastering controls. This is the smaller part of game, but there also might be possibly a level editor, for them to also spend time building and sharing levels with others. The gameplay is repetative, but it isn't gameplay what keeps the player - it's the time spent with friends, exactly like in most multiplayer games with easy core of logic.
