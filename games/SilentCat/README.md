Silent Cat

Team Members: SilvyIsMe(Silvy)!

How would you pitch your game in one line? It's a low poly 3d puzzle game where you play as a cat!

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? cat!

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) follow a simple (optional) story line and explore a city with many puzzles and rewards!

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? I want a very small open world where the player(cat) is allowed to travel as they wish and find hidden secrets and learn more about their life without any dialogue
