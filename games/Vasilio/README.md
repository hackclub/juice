**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Explore different realms, collect power ups and coins to help you battle realm bosses and their minions, and move on to the next realm!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The core fun of the game comes from mastering your momentum, making split second decisions, and defeating the bosses. based movement and split second decisions 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
In the game, the player is trying to finish a realm but to do so they must gather coins and beat the realm bosses and minions. Additionally, we plan on implementing a fighting mechanic (which involves combat and basic weapons). There will also be a shop mechanic where players can upgrade combat weapons, purchase armor (and other powerups), and improve their health if damaged by any minions 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
To keep the players engaged for up to 30 minutes, we're going to implement several different game mechanics like combat and health (which depreciates after x minutes) that the player must maintain to keep their progress. There will also be different bosses with unique abilities and the element of anticipation of the final realm boss. We will also include a game mode called RUSH, which is an endless running experience that increases in difficulty over time as the player's speed increases, while obstacles become harder. This mode is to provide a replayable challenge, with leaderboards and duels.
