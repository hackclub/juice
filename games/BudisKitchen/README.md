How would you pitch your game in one line? Its like overcooked but with monkeys meets work at a pizza place

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? You can upgrade to make your cooking go better and quicker while trying to make the best restraunt while customers give you reviews that determines how much money
you get

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) the player will start with a basic kitchen with nothing but a stove and a couple cousomers but as the game progresses the 
player will have to upgrade to accomadate for more customers and harder recipes 

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? the game will get harder as you go by making it so that customers order more, there are more
customers and that the cooking gets harder so you have to upgrade your equipment, space, and skills
