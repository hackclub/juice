# Zombie Horde

**Team Members:** Neil Dembla

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A top-down zombie shoot-em-up style game wave different weapons and upgrades, with some interesting movement mechanics.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You can only aim towards a beacon that shifts around the screen, so to properly kill the zombie's you'll have to make use of some movement tactics.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
[Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
You can move around a 2-d topdown world, only able to aim at a beacon that shifts position every 10-15 seconds. There will be some movement mechanics like dashing and teleporting directly to the beacon. Some maps will have obstacles that you'll have to maneuver around.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Every time you level up, you get a permanent upgrade: something that's permanently on your character. You can also buy upgrades in the shop using coins, or you can unlock different weapons, skin, and maps.
