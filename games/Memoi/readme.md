After certain stairs, the player will roam inside the house and have to remember its surroundings then, after some stairs, they will roam inside another room, in which some things would be missing, and they have to point out the differences.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

The player will have to build stairs with building blocks (literally building), which will be free-falling from the sky, and after each successful drop, the height/Shape/Dynamics of the free-fall might change accordingly, after a certain level, the player will roam inside a building block and have to memorise the minute details just like Sherlock Holmes did, and after a certain level, the same building will appear, and the player has to re-roam and point-out the changes.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

After each successful stair build, the player has to jump from the previous building block to the new one and so on, and if the player falls from the building or the building freefall fails, they have to start from the starting ground.
