# Realm of Rhythm

**Team Members:** Sunni Xue

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Music is a universal language, and what better way to learn it than gamification. It's like Pokemon, but you learn, battle, collect, and level up musical instruments while hosting epic rhythm-based concerts!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- Learning Instruments: Learn to "play" instruments and train them.
- Duels: Face off in rhythm-based mini games against NPCs to earn new instruments
- Inventory + Upgrades: Each instrument collected has unique rhythm mechanics and abilities that can be levelled up by using them in challenges and performances
- Concert Hosting: Players create setlists using their instruments and perform rhythm challenges during concerts to earncurrency and rewards
- Dynamic Music: Every action, duel, and performance is different, creating unique soundtrack for each player.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
- Explore a world divided into themed regions
- In each region, they encounter NPCs guarding instruments, which they must win by completing rhythm challenges
- Use earned XP and currency to upgrade instruments and unlock new abilities
- Host Concerts: Plan and "perform" concerts to entertain audiences, earn money, and recieve rewards.


**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
- Gradual unlocking of instruments, abilities, and regions
- Mini games have a variety of gameplay styles
- Personalize performances and to encourage creativity
- As players improve, challenges scale to test timing and precision
- Instruments have unique attributes and abilities, encouraging players to revisit old regions or challenges with new strategies
