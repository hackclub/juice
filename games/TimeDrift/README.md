# Time Drift

**Team Members:** Samuel John, Zachary Gurr

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Portal meets Outer Wilds but with time travel.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The time device allows you to travel back and forward through time. It’s a device that can only be used at a node. It’s important because it allows you to travel through different timelines to find unique paths forward.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
The loop is to solve a puzzle by moving through timelines to find ways to complete the objective and stop the evil guys. The player is trying to stop the evil guys from destroying all the timelines. As you progress, you unlock upgrades for your time device.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The puzzles are challenging but enjoyable, with an engaging story. There are hard boss fights. The difficulty will gradually evolve in difficulty. There will be nice visuals and intriguing storytelling.
