**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

A top-down stealth game where you use darkness to your advantage 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

The goal is to avoid getting caught (by cameras, guards, tripwires, and whatever else we can come up with) as you make your way through the level. By default, everything is pitch-black. You have a toggleable flashlight that you can use to orient yourself and find your way around the level. The key idea is that if you can't see yourself, neither can the cameras. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

You've forgotten some important files at the office, and now need to retrieve them (after hours!). You'll enter a planning stage (tbd) with the blueprints of the floor where you can mark your path. Once you actually begin, your goal is to make it to an elevator / staircase to progress to the next floor, picking up the documents you've forgotten along the way. Challenges will be slowly introduced as you climb the building (cameras with lights, distractible guards, pickable doors, etc). The win condition is climbing the entire building. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

We want it to be a kind of satisfying puzzle & stealth game (think hitman x teardown), so as mechanics are added they'll be combined to hopefully give rise to a wide range of complexity (e.g. getting past one camera is easy, but how about a guard with a light and two cameras? A guard near a door you need to pick?), with powerups/abilities adding even more level design possibilities (a speaker to distract guards, an EMP wave, etc).

We might add a challenge mode where you're timed and need to complete the level as quickly as possible (a speedrunning mode), so you can get the documents you need before the sun comes up.
