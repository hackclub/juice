# Pierogies Inc.

**Team Members:** Miłosz (uped)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Papa's Pizzeria, but with pierogies and Polish culture in 3D!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Managing your time with an ever-increasing number of customers, where you must multitask and stay focused to prepare pierogies for everyone.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Each day, when you open your restaurant, customers will start arriving and placing orders for different types of pierogies.
You’ll need to prepare them by completing mini-game-like tasks, such as rolling dough by tracing patterns with your mouse or joystick.
You will earn in-game currency based on the speed and quality of your work.
This currency can be spent on various decorations or kitchen upgrades (e.g., an automatic dough-rolling machine).
The game’s difficulty increases day by day, and as you progress, you’ll unlock new pierogi fillings to expand your menu.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will stay engaged with the increasing difficulty, unlocking new pierogi fillings, and purchasing upgrades and decorations for their restaurant.
