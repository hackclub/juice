# Forgotten Factory

**Team Members:** Loewe

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Its a Game set in a old factory where you play a robot and have to solve Portal-like Puzzles to get to the next room.
 
**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You controll a tiny robot that gains speficic abilities, like shooting arrows, moving objects or rerouting wires, and have to use these abilities in levels that get progressively complexer.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You start in an almost empty room and have to press a button to open a door to the next room, in the next room you gain the ability to move crates, so you have to move a crate onto a button to keep a door open to get to the next. 
The player wants to get to the end of the factory, and on the way find out about the history of this old factory.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Interesting and varying Levels/Rooms with increasing difficulty to challenge the player. Progression and also taking some abilities from the player in later levels can make the levels even more challenging
