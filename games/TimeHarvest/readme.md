**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like Stardew Valley meets a time-traveling adventure, where players evolve their farm and tools across different eras.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
- Era Progression: Players start with primitive tools and farming techniques, gradually advancing through historical and futuristic eras by unlocking upgrades with "time fragments."
- Tool Evolution: Tools and farming methods improve as players progress, offering new efficiencies and opportunities to farm in innovative ways (e.g., stone hoes evolve into laser plows).

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
1. **Farm and Harvest:**  
   - Players plant, water, and harvest crops manually using era-appropriate tools.  
   - Earn resources (e.g., coins or time fragments) by selling crops and completing tasks.  

2. **Upgrade and Progress:**  
   - Use resources and relics to unlock new eras, tools, and farming techniques.  
   - Each new era introduces faster tools, new crops, and expanded farming systems.  

3. **Explore and Discover:**  
   - Explore surrounding areas to collect seeds, time fragments, and blueprints.  
   - Solve small puzzles or overcome challenges to unlock advanced technologies.  

4. **Adapt to Challenges:**  
   - Manage era-specific obstacles like pests, weather conditions, pollution, or balancing technology and nature.  

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes?**
- **Short-Term Goals:** Players work daily to grow crops, earn resources, and upgrade tools.  
- **Mid-Term Goals:** Unlock new eras and discover rare relics or seeds.  
- **Long-Term Goals:** Fully upgrade your farm, master all eras, and create the ultimate futuristic or hybrid farm.  
- **Replayability:** Players can choose how they progress - focusing on exploration, efficient farming, or experimenting with tools and techniques.
