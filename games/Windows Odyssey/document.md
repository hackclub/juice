***How would you pitch your game in one line?***

A main character that fights corrupted machines to prevent a digital apocalypse, with a bunch of levels

***what is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?***

Each level alters platform behavior, forcing players to adapt. Difficulty-based enemies etc. And importantly game designs to be highly detailed

***how does the game actually play? (core game loop)***

- Navigate through platform challenges using tech-based elements

- Collect system files and power-ups to unlock new abilities
Defeat corrupted machines

***how will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? what's the general scope of your game (will change as you go?)***

As players journey through different levels, new enemies are introduced while previous ones remain relevant, adding progressive complexity. An achievement system. The general scope of the game is that it is going to consist of different era's with hopefully 3-4 levels in each, make it 15-20 levels throughout, but this is highly conceptual and don't know if it is going to turn out as hoped.
