***Windows Odyssey***

***How would you pitch your game in one line?***

A time-traveling stick figure platformer where you traverse through Windows operating system eras, using iconic OS elements as platforms while fighting corrupted programs to prevent a digital apocalypse.

***what is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?***

Each Windows version alters platform behavior, from stable Win11 widgets to flickering Win95 dialogs, forcing players to adapt. Era-based abilities, like Aero Peek for visibility in Win7 or XP’s restore points for checkpoints, stack as they progress. The OS dynamically transforms—taskbars become conveyor belts, and dialog boxes turn into moving platforms, reshaping challenges with each transition.

***how does the game actually play? (core game loop)***

- Navigate through platform challenges using Windows interface elements

- Collect system files and power-ups to unlock new abilities
Defeat corrupted programs using era-specific mechanics

- Progress to earlier Windows versions by finding special "legacy files"

***how will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? what's the general scope of your game (will change as you go?)***

As players journey through different Windows eras, new mechanics are introduced while previous ones remain relevant, adding progressive complexity. Hidden files and error messages uncover the story behind the system's corruption, creating narrative breadcrumbs. An achievement system, inspired by Windows' own certification and milestone systems, rewards players for their progress.

The general scope of the game is that it is going to consist of 5 different Windows era's with hopefully 3-4 levels in each, make it 15-20 levels throughout, but this is highly conceptual and don't know if it is going to turn out as hoped.
