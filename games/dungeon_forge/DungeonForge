**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
A challenging bullet hell game combining Hollow Knight's map design and Cuphead's level progression, with some tasteful twists in the player system.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The player's arsenal is customizable to a large degree, with various abilities and weapons you can collect throughout the journey. With a limited amount of slots the added difficulty of selecting the most useful spells, abilities and weapons adds a hard to master but fun mechanic.

**How does the game actually play?**
It's a bullet hell game with boss battles and run-and-gun sections. The player can collect new spells, abilities and weapons throughout the levels.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
At first we'll show you, how cool weapons, and abilities you can collect, as a teaser to know what's coming. Then you will be able to choose a difficulty before entering a level, where the loot will vary accordingly. This way, the player will want to play the level on the higher difficulty too.
