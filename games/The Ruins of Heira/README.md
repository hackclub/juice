**Team Members:** Mohammad Mudhaffar Al Ameri, Tony Deng

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like The Legend of Zelda meets Minecraft, but it's 2.5D.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The puzzles, buildings, or views for players to explore with and the freedom of crafting and building.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
As an open-world game, players can explore different places available and has the freedom to build their own. 
For exploration, there will be a large number of buildings, biomes, and views with awesome artwork to appreciate.
During exploring, players can go into different layers of the map, which is what makes the game "2.5D".
There will be different types of enemies that players will need to fight to continue exploring, which all have nice designs and mechanics.
For building, players will have a certain area where they can have the freedom to place items to build mechanisms similar to Minecraft Redstone,
or just normal buildings or artworks if not mechanisms.
For crafting, players will gain resources by exploring different places, and they can use those resources to craft items like tools, weapons, or mechanisms.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
Players will have a fresh experience every time they explore a new place and feel a sense of accomplishment when they successfully craft an item or build a mechanism, 
those are the two main things to do in the game, which rely on each other and make each other easier to do, and players mainly get entertained by doing them.
