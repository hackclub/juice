# IslandPuzzle

**Team Members:** Cosmin Mare

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
You are stranded on an island and will have to do various puzzles in an escape the room format, but with specific "tropical" objectives to progress to the next island and so on.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The puzzle solving and environment will be the main mechanics which will interact to make a unique game.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Players spawn on a seemingly empty island and will find puzzles along the way forcing them to discover the islands secrets and progress onto the next one. They will have to go through all sorts of puzzles and at the end they will get to discover why they got stranded.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
The general scope of my game is puzzle solving and I will keep players engaged with new and interesting puzzles, as well as discovering bits of the lore as their character starts remembering the crash
