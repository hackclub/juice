How would you pitch your game in one line? [example format: "It's like [Game X] meets [Game Y] but with [Unique Element Z]" (doesn't have to follow this format)]
It's like Tetris meets Sudoku with color-matching and a time-reversal mechanic.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun? [Describe how the mechanic works, why it's fun/important, how it interacts with other mechanics, etc]
Rotate and match colored tiles across rows and columns while racing against time. Use time-reversal to fix mistakes, adding strategy and tension. New puzzle types and power-ups keep it fresh.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop) [Describe what players do, what they're trying to achieve, what challenges they face, and what rewards they get, etc]
Match colors to clear tiles and earn points. Progress through increasingly difficult levels with new challenges like limited moves or locked tiles. Time pressure and the time-reversal mechanic make each decision crucial.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)? [Describe your plan for sustaining gameplay]

Remember: Focus on gameplay mechanics and player experience. Save the details about story, art style, sound design, UI flowcharts, marketing plans, or achievements for later.
Levels increase in difficulty with new mechanics and obstacles, keeping players challenged. Short, rewarding gameplay loops and new power-ups ensure steady engagement and progression.
