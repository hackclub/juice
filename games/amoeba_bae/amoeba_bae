Team Members: Dipsha

How would you pitch your game in one line?
Mermaids battling amoebas, collecting fish as weapons and resources, and cleaning up polluted waters in a dynamic, ever-challenging underwater world.

What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
Players must evade and fight amoebas while collecting fish, which double as weapons and resources. Pollution adds an evolving challenge, requiring players to clean the water to progress. Larger amoebas and rare fish add variety and strategy.

How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
Players control a mermaid swimming to collect fish, evade amoebas, and clean polluted water. Fish are fought for and used to attack amoebas or free themselves if engulfed. Cleaning the water restores visibility and mobility, unlocking new levels.

How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
Players face increasingly difficult amoebas, worsening pollution, and new environmental hazards as they progress. Power-ups, rare fish, and evolving challenges keep gameplay fresh. Levels offer dynamic underwater environments and leaderboard incentives for replayability.
