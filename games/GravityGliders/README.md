# Gravity Gliders

**Team Members:** [Shyaka Chaste & Munyarigoga Caleb Tola]

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**  
"It's like Mario Kart meets Portal but with gravity-flipping challenges."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**  
The key mechanic is the ability to flip gravity, letting players glide upside-down or right-side-up to navigate tricky obstacles. Itâ€™s fun because it creates a sense of freedom while requiring precise timing and skill. Players will need to master the gravity-flipping mechanic to solve puzzles, avoid traps, and collect items.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**  
1. Players control a glider through floating islands.  
2. They flip gravity to avoid obstacles like spinning blades, laser beams, or narrow paths.  
3. Players collect energy orbs to fuel their glider and gain points.  
4. The goal is to reach the end of the course as quickly as possible while collecting all orbs for a high score.  
5. Challenges increase as levels progress, adding new traps, faster-paced movement, and harder-to-reach collectibles.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**  
- Each level introduces new obstacles and mechanics to keep the game fresh.  
- Levels get more challenging, with harder obstacles and longer courses.  
- Hidden shortcuts and bonus collectibles encourage exploration and replay.
