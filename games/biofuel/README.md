# Game Name

**Team Members:** gbtsui (just me)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
What if Plants vs. Zombies was a roguelike hack-and-slash?

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The key mechanics are planting/harvesting plants and using them to create weapons and/or buffs, and rapid rotation of weapons. 

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Waves of AI-powered robots try to steal the player's potatoes for biofuel. The player will respond by respectfully annihilating said robots using
various different weapons such as farming tools, plant-based weapons of questionable legality, and really hot potatoes. The player has no real
objective other than trying to survive as long as possible. The game ends when the player runs out of health, or the player's potatoes are all
stolen. There is an upgrade system like BTD6, though. 

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
There's an infinite number of rounds. Players stay busy and get almost no breaks. No pausing, since I'm trying to go with the style of "this all 
happens in real time". The only breaks that a player gets are in between rounds when they have 90 seconds to upgrade their stuff and when the game
ends. The more you play, the harder the rounds get, but also, the more currency you can get to upgrade your plants and weapons.

Generally, the scope will remain pretty small. I want an infinite amount of progression within a finite amount of features, not a finite amount
of progression within an infinite amount of features.
