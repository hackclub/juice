"A lonely cafe in the middle of nowhere, a shattered juicer, and a cursed computer—dive into a surreal adventure where cleaning your desktop means unraveling dreamlike puzzles, unlocking strange programs, and chasing the one thing that matters: the perfect juice."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
"The game thrives on variety—offering a mix of quirky mini-games, mind-bending puzzles, and mysterious quests, all seamlessly tied together by a dreamlike atmosphere that keeps you curious about what’s coming next."

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
"You run a small cafe, but your real challenge lies in fixing a chaotic, dreamlike desktop on your old computer. By solving mini-games, puzzles, and mysterious quests, you collect fragments to unlock new chapters and explore surreal programs, uncovering secrets and working toward a mysterious final reward."

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
"Players will stay engaged through a mix of richly detailed worlds tied to each desktop fragment, offering fresh puzzles, funny and increasingly complex challenges, and hidden Easter eggs to discover. Balancing the demands of running the cafe while finding time to tackle the chaotic computer adds a layer of strategy, keeping players on their toes as they uncover secrets and progress deeper into the surreal experience."
