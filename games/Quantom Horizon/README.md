## How would you pitch your game in one line?
An amazing space based game which you can alternate between different timelines and choose which one will live! 

## What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?
The key mechanics of this game which would make and fun and amazing would be the alternation between timelines and space based adventure. The timelines will be unique will each have different outcomes. 

## How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)
You would startup in the middle of space with warnings saying oh no ship is going to explode, and you would activate an experimental machine which would  split your conscious between three time lines.  then you would go thru the story line to merge them back together.

## How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?
To keep them engaged within the 3 split up conciseness you will have side quests which are unique to that conscious, global sidequests, LB, quests and the story itself. there will also hopefully be some easter eggs which don't overpower you but grant you cool cosmetics etc.
