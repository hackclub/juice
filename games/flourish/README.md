# Flourish

**Team Members:** Noololly (Olly) Junyali (Jun Jia)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?** Our game flourish will have "corrupted" worlds, one example of which could be a polluting factory in the centre, surrounded by a wasteland. You will have to plant flowers, nature and creatures to restore the landscape of the current world, while fighting the world's monsters monsters trying to stop you from achieving this.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?** The game will have a variety of puzzles to unlock new items to help rewild the world. Some resource gathering from previously rewilded sections to contiue the main quest of rewilding, as well as elements of combat.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)** The game in each world will start from the outside of a relatively large map, on a small section, with the starting materials to begin rewilding. The player will then reach the middle of the map, where the source of "evilness" sits (e.g., a polluting factory). They will then defeat the evil source and complete the healing of the newly flourishing world.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?** The game will unlock new items to keep rewilding against toughening conditions as they near the centre of the map. The puzzles will provide a challenge, instead of making it too easy, and force critical thinking from the player!
