**Team Members:** Thomas Wu, Zigao Wang, Lily Ding

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
"It's like Stardew Valley meets Factorio, but with apple juice production and a dynamic, open-source economy."

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
The fun comes from planting apple trees, mixing apples to make creative juice flavors, and managing your growing business. You'll build your own apple juice empire by experimenting with different apple types, upgrading your machines, and selling your products in a changing market. The game’s mix of farming, crafting, and business strategy keeps it exciting and fun!

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You start by planting apple trees and taking care of them. Once you harvest your apples, you mix them to create different juice flavors. You can sell your juice, make money, and use it to upgrade your farm and machines. There are challenges, like pests and bad weather, that you have to deal with to keep your business running smoothly. As you grow, you can create new recipes and expand your farm into a bigger juice empire!

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
You’ll stay busy by planting new apples, mixing fun juice recipes, and selling them to make money. The game keeps things fresh with random events like changing market prices, weather surprises, and pest problems that keep you on your toes. The more you play, the more upgrades and new juice flavors you can unlock. Plus, since the game is open-source, players can add their own cool ideas and mods, so there’s always something new to try!
