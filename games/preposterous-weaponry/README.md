# Preposterous Weaponry

**Team Members:** MathR

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
Someone goes around a spaceship killing aliens and upgrading their gun to a ridiculous patchwork.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
You have 1 (one) gun during the whole game. As you explore the ship you collect upgrades that add new elements to your gun. Ideally each part can be triggered by a different keybind so that you have to smash your keyboard in order to do a maximum of damage.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
You explore a huge spaceship, like in a metroidvania
You shoot enemies and you look around for upgrades to help you shoot more enemies
Sometimes specific upgrades are required for a specific task. For example if there's an evil bottomless pit blocking your progress, find the upgrade that adds a super big barrel with lots of knockback to your gun and use the knockback to jump over the pit. Armored alien that your bullets cannot pierce? Flamethrower. Cannot survive the heat forever. An alien regenerates HP super quickly? Well just do more DPS it's not that complicated

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
With lots of upgrades to find I guess.
