## How would you pitch your game in one line?  
A simplified factory-building simulation where players construct machines, manage resources, and adapt to an alien world.  

## What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?  
The core mechanics revolve around building and optimizing a factory using machines, conveyor belts, and crafting recipes. Players strategically place machines and belts to create efficient production chains, while interacting with the worldâ€™s environment and its alien creatures. The balance between factory management, resource collection, and environmental challenges creates engaging and rewarding gameplay.  

## How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)  
Players start by gathering resources and setting up basic machines to create essential products. Conveyor belts transport materials between machines, enabling automation. As the factory grows, players unlock more recipes, build floors and structures for organization, and explore different biomes like lava fields, icy plains, and water regions. These biomes present unique challenges, such as avoiding harmful aliens or adapting factory designs to environmental hazards. Players must continuously expand and optimize their factory for higher efficiency.  

## How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?  
The game keeps players engaged by providing constant goals: unlocking new machines and recipes, improving production efficiency, and exploring the alien world. Players will face challenges like resource scarcity, alien interference, and environmental obstacles, encouraging creative problem-solving. The general scope is focused yet dynamic, offering machines, conveyor belts, and crafting recipes alongside an immersive pixel-art world filled with alien creatures and environmental variety.
