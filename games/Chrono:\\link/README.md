"Here lies two souls, trapped in different timelines, must solve puzzles, leave clues, and alter fate before time runs out."

**Overview**

Chrono:\Link is a time-bending puzzle game where two characters, trapped in different timelines, must solve puzzles, leave clues, and alter fate before time runs out.
Every action in one world impacts the other, and mistakes cause glitches that distort reality.

⟢ Time is limited for each puzzle.
⟢ Players switch between two characters in different timelines.
⟢ No dialogue—characters "speak" through pixelated, distorted sounds.
⟢ Failing puzzles causes glitches, leading to timeline corruption.

**Core Gameplay Loop**

⟢ Solve a puzzle before time runs out.
⟡ Each puzzle is timed. Solving it correctly reveals more clues about the other character, connecting the timelines.
⟡ Running out of time or failing introduces glitches, distorting the next sequence.

⟢ Switch characters and deal with consequences.
⟡ After solving (or failing) a puzzle, control shifts to the other character.
⟡ The next puzzle reflects past decisions, forcing players to adapt to a changing world.

⟢ Glitches stack over time.
⟡ Minor glitches create small distortions (visual errors, missing objects).
⟡ Major glitches cause severe corruption (hallucinations, input lag, unpredictable mechanics).
⟡ Extreme glitches make characters’ speech unintelligible, reducing communication to raw noise.

⟢ Race against reality collapse.
⟡ Too many glitches lead to a fail-state timeline where puzzles become significantly harder.
⟡ The final sequence forces players to fix the timeline before it collapses completely.

**Key Mechanics**

⟢ Time-Switching Puzzle Solving – Solving a puzzle in one timeline provides clues that connect it to the other.
⟢ Glitch & Consequence System – Mistakes introduce corruption, making the game progressively harder.
⟢ Clue-Relay Communication – Players must leave messages for their counterpart through environmental changes.
⟢ Distorted Speech System – No spoken dialogue—characters communicate through pixelated sounds that degrade as glitches increase.

**Scope and Engagement**

⟢ Timed puzzles create urgency and force quick thinking.
⟢ Early puzzles introduce mechanics, while later ones increase difficulty with shorter timers and more layered interactions.
⟢ The glitch system acts as a soft difficulty curve, making failure an evolving challenge rather than a simple game-over.
⟢ Multiple possible endings based on how well players connect the timelines and manage glitches.
