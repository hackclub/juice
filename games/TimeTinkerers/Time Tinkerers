Pitch
"It's like Portal meets Stardew Valley but with time-bending puzzles and collaborative tinkering mechanics."

Key Mechanic(s)
Time Manipulation: Players can rewind, pause, or fast-forward time in specific zones to solve puzzles. For example, rewinding might rebuild a broken bridge, or fast-forwarding could make a plant grow instantly.
Cooperative Tinkering: Players team up to build machines or gadgets using items scattered across levels. Each player controls a different tool (e.g., a wrench, screwdriver, or blueprint). Combining these actions in the correct sequence unlocks progress.
Dynamic Environments: The world changes based on the player's time manipulations, creating unexpected challenges and opportunities (e.g., opening hidden paths, triggering traps).
Core Game Loop
Explore: Players explore the environment to find components and clues.
Tinker: They solve puzzles by assembling machines or altering the environment using their tools and time powers.
Challenge: They encounter obstacles like locked doors, broken paths, or environmental hazards that require creative teamwork.
Reward: Successfully solving puzzles earns players new tools, upgrades to time powers, and unlocks new areas or lore about the world.
Keeping Players Engaged for 30 Minutes
Layered Puzzles: Each puzzle requires multiple steps to solve, encouraging teamwork and experimentation.
Progression Rewards: Players unlock new abilities (e.g., slowing down enemies) or discover new areas that reveal parts of the game’s mystery.
Time Pressure: Introduce time-limited challenges or zones that keep the pace exciting.
Secrets and Collectibles: Hide optional challenges, easter eggs, or lore bits for curious players to find.
General Scope
The game will feature a 3-hour campaign divided into 6-8 levels, with each level introducing a new time manipulation mechanic or tool. The art style will be whimsical and steampunk-inspired to match the tinkering theme. Future updates could include competitive or PvP modes where players sabotage each other’s progress!
