**How would you pitch your game in one line?**

It's like Celeste meets Hollow Knight but with a "Just Do It and move forward" theme, where every action and decision feels like a bold leap forward.

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**

Players will navigate the levels using WASD (or arrow keys) for movement, traversing through challenging platforming sections filled with dynamic obstacles such as moving platforms, crumbling tiles, and narrow jumps. Combat is seamlessly integrated into the gameplay—players engage enemies by clicking on them with the mouse, creating a fluid mix of movement and action.
Occasionally, players will ascend to mountain peaks or scenic vistas, where they can pause to admire a beautiful sunset, offering moments of motivation and reflection amidst the action. Adding vertical exploration, rope-based elevators allow players to move up and down.

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**

Players explore, leap, and battle their way through vibrant pixel-art environments. Each level challenges them to overcome tricky platforming obstacles and defeat enemies seamlessly integrated into the terrain. The ultimate objective is to reach a glowing exit or achieve a specific goal, such as retrieving a key item or unlocking a door. Along the way, players can uncover hidden food and supplies tucked away in shelves, barrels, or other secret spots, rewarding curiosity and exploration.

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**

Early levels teach mechanics through easy enemies. Later levels gradually increase the difficulty, introducing new platforming hazards, enemy types. Will design levels to take 3–5 minutes to complete, so players can feel constant progress and success. Also each time player goes to a new level the design of game theme will change and a new environment will be given! A climactic battle against a boss representing doubt or fear, requiring players to use everything they’ve learned in an intense sequence.
There will be zones which include triggers (e.g., stepping on a switch activates spikes or opens a gate for a few seconds) to create urgency. These zones will also include dynamic dangers like collapsing platforms, spiked walls that close in, or enemies that ambush you suddenly.
