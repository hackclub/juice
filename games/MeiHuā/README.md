**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
its a cozy gardening game that meets magick spells 

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
"blobby boba drops" :tm:  that guide you through the world and act as your loveably cute and clumsy companions. they grant you the ability to use earth magick distilled from the flowers of the cherry trees they tend. you use this magick to expand the garden and clear away the ivy that coats everything discovering ancient statues as you go

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
clear away ivy, meet new statue, defeat statue, add more plants to garden, grow your boba blobs from the plants

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
lore much much lore; the challenge will be communicating that purely through pixels and music
side quests: defeat mobs with spells and potions crafted by the loot drops from previous mobs, items collected on journeys, and brewing them up
