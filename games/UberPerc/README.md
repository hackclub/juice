**Team Members:** George W. (yep just me) (i know some musician friends who may be indirectly involved, more info to come)

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's singleplayer Team Fortress 2 with the gameplay of Osu!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
FPS Rhythm - all actions have to be in sync with music (e.g. firing at targets, reloading, spinning up minigun, swapping weapons)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Like the typical rhythm game, it contains levels/maps of varying difficulty where the user has to play to the beat. The user has to select the proper weapon [initially pistol, shotgun, minigun, and rocket launcher] to shoot moving targets of varying durabilities and sizes (sliders and taps in osu!), keep time, and reload, all in sync of a certain song. Like any other rhythm game, it will have a scoring mechanism and grade based on % of maximum score. This score can then be used to cash in for in-game currency, which will be required for the final boss levels (e.g. Rhythm Heaven Megamix).

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
About 10-15 levels of increasing difficulty (some by me, some possibly by my friends)
(3 stages, 3-5 levels per stage, plus one boss fight-esque experience)

fun fact: the name is a portmanteau of Ubercharge (TF2) and Percussion
