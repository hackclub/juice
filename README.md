## What is Juice? 🍹

Join us for a two-month game development journey where you and your friends build a game, travel to Shanghai, and then run a pop-up café where visitors can play and experience your creation!

## Game Criteria 🎮

To participate, your game should meet the following criteria:

- **Language-free**: No written or spoken words used in the game or interface.
- **Playable content**: A minimum of 30 minutes of engaging gameplay.
- **Time investment**: At least 100 hours spent on game development.
- **Steam launch**: Publish the game on the Steam store.

## Who Can Join? 🌍

This event is open to all high schoolers who have created a game! (Travel stipends provided.)

## How Can I Get Started? 🚀

To begin, simply add your game idea to the **games** folder to kickstart your project.

## Event Dates 📅

The event will take place from **April 4th to April 11th**!

## What to Expect at the Café? ☕️

The café will feature several computers running the games created by participants, providing an immersive experience for visitors who can walk in and try out the games. Details will be decided collaboratively in the [#juice](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C088UF12N1Z) Slack channel.

## New to Game Development? 🎮

No worries! Start with beginner-friendly game engines like **Unity** or **Godot** to create your first game.

## Managing 100 Hours of Development 💻

Here’s a suggested breakdown for your 100 hours:

1. **15 hours**: Develop a Proof of Concept — Focus on the core gameplay without worrying about art or sound.
2. **30 hours**: Create a Vertical Slice — Enhance one section of your game (typically the opening), adding visuals, sound, and other elements.
3. **45 hours**: Full Game Development — Build out the rest of the game with the refined mechanics and assets. Upload your game to **itch.io** for early playtesting.
4. **10 hours**: Polish and Debug — Refine your game, fix bugs, and prepare it for release on **Steam**.
