Spend 2 months building a game with your friends, go to Shanghai, China, and then run a popup cafe for people from the streets to come in and try our games!

## What's the criteria for the games? üëæ

- Languageless (no use of written or spoken word in the game or the game's interface)
- 30+ minutes of playable content
- 100+ hours of time spent building
- Launch onto the Steam store

## Who can come? üòÑ

Any high schooler that makes a game! (Travel stipends provided.)

## How do I get started? üóÇÔ∏è

Add your game idea to the games folder to get started!

## When is it happening? üóìÔ∏è

April 4th - April 11th!

## What's the cafe going to be like? ‚òïÔ∏è

We'll decide the specifics together in the [#juice](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C088UF12N1Z) channel. It will be full of computers running our games where anyone can come in and play!

## New to making games? üëæ

No problem! Me too. Try using Unity or Godot! 

## How do I spend 100 hours making the game? üíª

*(Rough outline)*

1. 15 hours: Make the proof of concept (no art, no sounds, just the core game mechanic and gameplay).
2. 30 hours: Take a vertical slice of your game & make it great (this means take a section‚Äîtypically the start‚Äîand increase the fidelity. Here's where the art, sounds, story, colors, etc., come into play).
3. 45 hours: Build your game! You have the gameplay, you know the style‚Äînow build it. Ship it onto itch.io and get people playing it.
4. 15 hours: Polish, fix bugs, and get ready to post on the Steam store.

You should log your time working on your game on [juice.hackclub.com](https://juice.hackclub.com/) by tapping "Start Juicing." Juice until you reach an "OMG IT WORKS" moment in your process. At that point, film a quick demo, share it on the Juice site, and then get back to juicing!

Your demo videos you upload throughout the day will be shared on the Kudos app on the site. Other Hack Clubbers will see your progress and can interact with it by giving "Kudos."

## Where will I stay while I'm there? üè†

We'll provide housing! More details to come :)
